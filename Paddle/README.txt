Controls
Player Paddle (Right side): up and down arrow keys
Enemy Paddle (Left side): W and S 

When a player or enemy wins the game, there will 
be a message printed out to std::cout "Player Wins!" or "Enemy Wins!"

If the starting angle is too steep, then restart the game to get a random starting ball vector.
