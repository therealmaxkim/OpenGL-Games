When a player or enemy wins the game, there will 
be a message printed out to std::cout "Player Wins!" or "Enemy Wins!"

Enemy will win if any enemy reaches the bottom of the screen. 

Please note: initial lag when first running the program may cause the enemies to be misaligned. This problem can be fixed by simply restarting the game (closing window and playing again).
